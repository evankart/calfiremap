# Cal Firemap

## Description

Interactive map of wildfires in California since 1950. Data provided by the [California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection](https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/datasets/CALFIRE-Forestry::california-fire-perimeters-1950/about). Built with React and Mapbox GL.

## Background
Anyone whoâ€™s lived in California in recent years can tell you how difficult the fire seasons have been, with smoke looming over large portions of the state year after year. But, you might be surprised to see just how much things have changed in the past few decades.

Cal Firemap is designed to provide context and a sense of scale to climate-influenced wildfire events. Only with a firm understanding of the impacts of a changing climate will we be able to find real solutions for a cleaner future.
